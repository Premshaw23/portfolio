# Python Basics Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive Python basics tutorial! Whether you're completely new to programming or coming from another language, this guide will help you understand Python fundamentals and gradually introduce you to more intermediate and advanced topics.

## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It's widely used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

### Why Learn Python?

- **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is simple and mirrors natural language.
- **Versatile**: Supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Large Community and Ecosystem**: Tons of libraries and frameworks for every use case.
- **Great for Beginners and Experts**: Widely recommended as a first programming language.

## Basics

### 1. Installing Python

- Download from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Verify installation by running:

  ```bash
  python --version
---

Then the rest in plain text (no markdown formatting):

### 2. Your First Python Program

Let's print "Hello, World!" — the classic beginner’s program:

print("Hello, World!")

### 3. Variables and Data Types

Python variables store data and are dynamically typed.

# Integer
age = 25
# Float
height = 5.9
# String
name = "Alice"
# Boolean
is_student = True

print(age, height, name, is_student)

### 4. Basic Input and Output

Get user input and display output:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

### 5. Operators

- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ** (exponentiation)
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical: and, or, not

Example:

a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # 13
print(a ** b) # 1000
print(a > b and b > 0)  # True

### 6. Control Flow: Conditions and Loops

If-Else Statements

num = 7

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

Loops

- For loop

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

- While loop

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
